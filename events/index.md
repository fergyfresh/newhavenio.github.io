Events are a great way to meet fellow NewHaven.IO members in person to network and learn more. There's several event types to look forward to:

* **Hack Nights** - Members gather to work on projects, share advice, and hack away at whatever's on their minds. People can give small talks or demo their code for others if they want. Held on the first Thursday of each month.
* **Workshops** - Members lead others in small code workshops, such as setting up different apps or using a specific technology. Members can reach out in our organizing channel on Slack to set one up.
* **Social Nights** - Members gather at a casual New Haven pub, restaurant, or any social setting. We chat about anything on our minds, not just our code. These are usually organized from our Slack channel based on if enough members are interested and available.
* **Talks** - Members can give talks on any topic of their choosing, usually given with slides or code demos. Talk nights can be one longer talk or several shorter ones. Members can reach out in our organizing channel on Slack to set one up.
* **Study Halls** - Members gather in a more quiet, focused environment to get work done. You can hack on your own or seek out other programmers for advice.
